### About me:

+ Math student at Stockholm University in the division of mathematical statistics.
+ Working within stochastic control theory, optimal stopping, stochastic game theory and stochastic optimalization in general.
+ Also working in national science center grant ([ncn-foreigners](https://github.com/ncn-foreigners)) on single source capture-capture estimation models that utilize count data regression and their implementation in `singleRcapture` and `singleRcaptureExtra` packages and on mathematical aspects of non-probability sample inference.
+ Mostly using `R` and `julia` with some knowledge of `python`.
